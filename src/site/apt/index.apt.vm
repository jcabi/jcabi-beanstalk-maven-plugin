Amazon Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Maven Plugin

  The plugin automates deployment of Java WAR applications
  to {{{http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/}Amazon Elastic Beanstalk}}.
  The plugin is designed with a minimalistic
  approach, so that you don't need to provide a lot of configuration
  options. Instead, there are a few conventions:

   * CNAME of a "primary" environment
     is always the same as the application name;

   * Environments are configured only by
     {{{http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.managing.html#using-features.managing.saving}saved configuration templates}};

   * Deployment is done either by
     {{{http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.CNAMESwap.html}CNAME swap}}
     or version update;

   * An application always contains only one "primary" environment.

  See {{{./usage.html}usage page}}.

  If you need more precise and custom configuration we recommend to use
  {{{http://beanstalker.ingenieux.com.br/beanstalk-maven-plugin/}beanstalk-maven-plugin}}.
