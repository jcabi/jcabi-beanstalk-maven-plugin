Package ".ebextensions" for Amazon Elastic Beanstalk

  For in-server operations Amazon Elastic Beanstalk proposes a
  mechanism based on {{{http://yaml.org/spec/history/2001-08-01.html}YAML}}
  <<<.config>>> configuration files stored in
  <<<.ebextensions>>> directory of your WAR package.
  Read more about them
  {{{http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customize-containers.html}here}}.
  Also, pay attention to
  {{{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/environment-resources.html}configurable resources}}.

  This is how we recommend to package these files in Maven.
  Configure <<<maven-war-plugin>>> in <<<pom.xml>>>:

+--
<plugin>
  <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    [...other configuration...]
    <webResources>
      <resource>
        <directory>src/main/ebextensions</directory>
        <targetPath>.ebextensions</targetPath>
        <filtering>true</filtering>
      </resource>
    </webResources>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
+--

  All of them will be picked up by <<<maven-war-plugin>>> during packaging,
  filtered (all <<<${sign}\{...\}>>> sequences replaced with real values),
  and placed into <<<.ebextensions>>> directory of WAR archive.

  This mechanism can be very useful for, say,
  {{{./example-syslog.html}syslog configuration}}.
