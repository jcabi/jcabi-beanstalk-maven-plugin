Mount EBS Volume to Amazon Elastic Beanstalk Environment

  Sometimes it is necessary to use disc storage in your Elastic
  Beanstalk environment. And you need this storage to be persistent
  between environment terminations. The best option is to attach
  an EBS volume to a running EC2 instance on boot up (it will be
  automatically detached on termination of the instance). Full workflow is
  as following:

   * Check whether the EBS volume is already attached to the current EC2 instance
     (if it is, ignore the rest of the workflow);

   * Attach the given EBS volume to the current instance

   * Create a new directory

   * Mount the device to the directory

   * Change permissions of the directory to enable Tomcat access to it

  Let's configure this workflow using <<<ebextensions>>> (read more about them
  {{{http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customize-containers.html}here}}).
  Create a <<<ebs-volume.config>>> file in <<<src/main/ebextensions>>>:

+--
commands:
  01-attach-volume:
    command: |
      export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre && \
      export EC2_HOME=/opt/aws/apitools/ec2 && \
      export IN_USE=${sign}(/opt/aws/bin/ec2-describe-volumes --hide-tags \
        --aws-access-key ${sign}{aws.key} \
        --aws-secret-key ${sign}{aws.secret} \
        ${sign}{ebs.volume} | grep "in-use") && \
      if [ -z "${sign}{IN_USE}" ]; then
        /opt/aws/bin/ec2-attach-volume ${sign}{ebs.volume} \
          -i ${sign}(/opt/aws/bin/ec2-metadata --instance-id | cut -c14-) \
          -d /dev/sdf \
          --aws-access-key ${sign}{aws.key} \
          --aws-secret-key ${sign}{aws.secret} &&
        mkdir -p /mnt/ebs-volume &&
        sleep 30 && \
        mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/ebs-volume && \
        chown -R tomcat.tomcat /mnt/ebs-volume
      fi
+--

  As you see, this <<<ebs-volume.config>>> file doesn't contain real
  security data like AWS key, secret key, or volume name. This information
  has to be provided to Maven during build time in your <<<settings.xml>>> file
  (for example):

+--
<settings>
  <profile>
    <id>production</id>
    <properties>
      <ebs.volume>vol-8a8a8a8a</ebs.volume>
      <aws.key>AKIA3G4DFXFQJI8U6CQA</aws.key>
      <aws.secret>Z9ISuYTdV7kIV50YWT3uaycJ4fw+3uQ+XtEVIV1t</aws.secret>
    </properties>
  </profile>
</settings>
+--

  During packaging, as suggested in {{{./example-ebextensions.html}here}}, the
  properties will be substituted by <<<maven-war-plugin>>>.

  That's it. On every reboot (or restart) of the EC2 instance your EBS volume
  will be attached to it. In this example we assumed that your Elastic Beanstalk
  application has only one environment (and never scale up). For bigger
  cases with many environments in one application you probably have to use
  some service-oriented solutions, like database servers, search engine servers,
  etc.
