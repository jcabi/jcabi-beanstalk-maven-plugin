Deploying WAR projects to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

  {{{http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.deployment.newapp.html}Create
  new application}} in Amazon Elastic Beanstalk.

  Configure running environment and save configuration template.
  Don't forget that you can
  {{{http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/10/customize-elastic-beanstalk-using-configuration-files.html}customize
  your app with configuration files}} as explained
  {{{http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customize-containers.html}here}}.

  Configure <<<jcabi-beanstalk-maven-plugin>>> in your <<<pom.xml>>>:

+--
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>com.jcabi</groupId>
        <artifactId>jcabi-beanstalk-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <name>example</name>
          <bucket>webapps.example.com</bucket>
          <key>${sign}{project.artifactId}-${sign}{project.version}.war</key>
          <template>example</template>
        </configuration>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>deploy</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
+--

  Run <<<mvn deploy>>>.

  That's all you need. Application name has to be the same as
  the CNAME of environment.
  Server has to be defined in <<<settings.xml>>> with <<<username>>>
  and <<<password>>> (AWS IAM key and secret key).

  If you have any problems - don't hesitate to submit a ticket
  to {{{https://github.com/yegor256/jcabi}github}}.
